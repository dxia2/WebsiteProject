                     is one of my favourite types of chair because it's very versatile and comfy.
                    It works well in any room in a house, from the living room to the bedroom. 
                    The definition of an armchair is a chair with armrests.

                     is another one of my favourites because it's mobile and adjustable, 
                     making it great for people of all sizes. 
                     Fun fact, office chairs were developed around the mid-19th century 
                     as more workers spent their time sitting at desks. 
                     This lead to the creation of several features not found on other chairs.

                     was a great innovation in the world of chairs 
                     because it gives people a place to rest outside their homes. 
                    Benches can be found everywhere in a city, such as parks, on the street or in a hotel.
